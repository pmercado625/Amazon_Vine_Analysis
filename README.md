Above is a snippet from the analysis code used to analyze the reviews for the paid and unpaid reviews, respectively.  
- For the paid reviews, there were 48 5 star reviewsout of the total 94 reviews, meaning ~51% of these reviews were 5 star reviews.  
- For the unpaid reviews, there were 15,663 5 star reviews out of 40,471 total reviews, meaning ~39% of the reviews were 5 star reviews.
## Summary
In this analysis, we examined the differences in reviews between people who did participate in Amazon's vine program (paid) and people who did not participate (unpaid). Through this analysis we were able to draw possible conclusions about biases:
- The paid reviews had more positive (5 star) reviews, percentage-wise. This could be attributed to the fact that there was monetary compensation (or just any compensation) involved within creating the reviews. This could serve as possible motivation and would posit the reviewer to be in a friendlier/more satisfied mood when creating the review.
- The unpaid reviews were as stated, unpaid. Therefore, there was no particular incentive to offer good reviews. It's entirely possible that these reviews are more critical and receptive to possible negative aspects during the review process.
